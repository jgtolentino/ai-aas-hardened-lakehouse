```
S3/ADLS2 → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Dashboard
```

**✅ Similarity**: 95% identical to Databricks' recommended pattern

---

### 2. **Multi-Environment Strategy**

#### **Enterprise Pattern** (Netflix, Spotify, Uber):
```
Development → Staging → Production
   ↓            ↓          ↓
Sample Data  Test Data   Real Data
```

#### **Our Implementation**:
```
Development → Staging → Production
   ↓            ↓          ↓
scout-sample → scout-staging → scout-production
```

**✅ Similarity**: Identical to enterprise standards

---

### 3. **Serverless ETL** (AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory)

#### **Cloud Provider Pattern**:
- **AWS**: Lambda + Glue + S3 + RDS
- **Azure**: Functions + Data Factory + ADLS2 + SQL
- **GCP**: Cloud Functions + Dataflow + GCS + BigQuery

#### **Our Implementation**:
- **Supabase**: Edge Functions + S3/ADLS2 + PostgreSQL

**✅ Similarity**: 90% equivalent functionality at 1/10th the cost
