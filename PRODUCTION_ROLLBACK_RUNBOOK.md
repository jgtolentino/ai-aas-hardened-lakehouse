# Scout v5.2 - Production Rollback & Recovery Runbook üö®

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### Quick Actions (60-Second Response)

#### üõë **STOP INGESTION** (Critical Issues)
```sql
-- Immediately pause all ingestion processing
SELECT scout.control_ingestion('pause');

-- Verify ingestion is stopped
SELECT * FROM scout.control_ingestion('status');
```

#### üîç **ASSESS DAMAGE** (Health Check)
```sql
-- Check pipeline health
SELECT * FROM scout.v_ingest_freshness;

-- Check for critical alerts
SELECT * FROM scout.v_quality_alerts WHERE severity = 'critical';

-- Review data quality report
SELECT * FROM scout.data_quality_report(1); -- Last 1 hour
```

#### üìä **QUARANTINE DATA** (Suspect Transactions)
```sql
-- Move suspect data to Dead Letter Queue
INSERT INTO scout.bronze_events_dlq (
    original_payload, error_code, error_message, source_system
)
SELECT 
    event_data,
    'QUARANTINE',
    'Emergency quarantine during incident response',
    source_system
FROM scout.bronze_events
WHERE ingested_at >= '[INCIDENT_START_TIME]'::timestamptz;

-- Delete from main processing tables
DELETE FROM scout.bronze_events 
WHERE ingested_at >= '[INCIDENT_START_TIME]'::timestamptz;
```

## üîß Recovery Procedures

### Scenario 1: Data Quality Issues

#### Problem: Bad transaction data causing math violations
```sql
-- 1. Identify affected time window
SELECT MIN(processed_at), MAX(processed_at), COUNT(*)
FROM scout.silver_transactions
WHERE total_amount < 0 OR item_count <= 0;

-- 2. Quarantine affected transactions
INSERT INTO scout.bronze_events_dlq (
    original_payload, error_code, error_message
)
SELECT 
    jsonb_build_object('transaction_id', transaction_id),
    'INVALID_AMOUNTS',
    'Negative amounts detected',
    'data_quality'
FROM scout.silver_transactions
WHERE total_amount < 0;

-- 3. Clean up silver data
DELETE FROM scout.silver_line_items 
WHERE transaction_id IN (
    SELECT transaction_id FROM scout.silver_transactions 
    WHERE total_amount < 0
);

DELETE FROM scout.silver_transactions WHERE total_amount < 0;

-- 4. Resume ingestion
SELECT scout.control_ingestion('resume');
```

### Scenario 2: ETL Processing Stuck

#### Problem: Bronze ‚Üí Silver processing stopped/delayed
```sql
-- 1. Check for stuck advisory locks
SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE locktype = 'advisory' AND NOT granted;

-- 2. Kill stuck processes (if found)
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE query LIKE '%load_silver_from_bronze%' 
  AND state = 'active'
  AND query_start < now() - interval '10 minutes';

-- 3. Clear advisory locks (nuclear option)
SELECT pg_advisory_unlock_all();

-- 4. Restart ETL processing
SELECT scout.load_silver_from_bronze(1000);
```

### Scenario 3: Time Window Reprocessing

#### Problem: Need to reprocess specific time period
```sql
-- 1. Reprocess Bronze events for time window
SELECT scout.reprocess_bronze_window(
    '2025-08-24 14:00:00+08'::timestamptz,
    '2025-08-24 16:00:00+08'::timestamptz,
    2000  -- batch size
);

-- 2. Verify reprocessing results
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as reprocessed_transactions,
    MIN(processed_at) as earliest_processed,
    MAX(processed_at) as latest_processed
FROM scout.silver_transactions
WHERE processed_at >= now() - interval '1 hour';
```

### Scenario 4: Gold Layer Refresh Issues

#### Problem: Materialized views not refreshing
```sql
-- 1. Check refresh status
SELECT * FROM scout.v_gold_freshness;

-- 2. Manual refresh with monitoring
SELECT scout.refresh_gold_platinum();

-- 3. If refresh fails, check dependencies
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW scout.gold_daily_metrics;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW scout.gold_region_choropleth;
```

## üìã Incident Response Checklist

### Phase 1: Detection & Assessment (0-5 minutes)
- [ ] **Alert received** - identify incident type and severity
- [ ] **Run health check** - `SELECT * FROM scout.v_ingest_freshness;`
- [ ] **Check data quality** - `SELECT * FROM scout.data_quality_report(1);`
- [ ] **Assess impact scope** - number of affected transactions/time window
- [ ] **Notify stakeholders** if critical business impact

### Phase 2: Immediate Containment (5-15 minutes)
- [ ] **Stop ingestion** if data integrity issues - `SELECT scout.control_ingestion('pause');`
- [ ] **Quarantine suspect data** to Dead Letter Queue
- [ ] **Document incident timeline** and symptoms observed
- [ ] **Preserve evidence** - export relevant logs and data samples

### Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis (15-45 minutes)
- [ ] **Analyze pipeline logs** - check ETL performance metrics
- [ ] **Review recent changes** - deployments, configuration updates
- [ ] **Check external dependencies** - upstream data sources, API changes
- [ ] **Identify fix** required - code change, configuration, or data correction

### Phase 4: Recovery & Validation (45+ minutes)
- [ ] **Apply fix** - deploy correction or data repair
- [ ] **Reprocess affected data** using time window functions
- [ ] **Run acceptance gate** - `scripts/ci/accept_streaming_gate.sh`
- [ ] **Resume ingestion** - `SELECT scout.control_ingestion('resume');`
- [ ] **Monitor recovery** - watch metrics for 30 minutes post-recovery

### Phase 5: Post-Incident (2+ hours)
- [ ] **Document root cause** and resolution steps
- [ ] **Update monitoring** to prevent similar incidents
- [ ] **Schedule retrospective** with team
- [ ] **Update runbook** with lessons learned

ALTER TABLE scout.table_name DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS new_column;
```

### Application Rollback
```bash
# Rollback Edge Function deployment
supabase functions deploy ingest-transaction --no-verify-jwt
