# SKU Catalog Deployment Status

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Schema Sync Infrastructure**
   - Created `sync-scout-schema.sh` script
   - Created GitHub Action for daily sync
   - Configured `.scout-sync-config.json`
   - Identified 14 Scout-related migrations

2. **SKU Catalog Migration Files**
   - Core migration: `20250823_import_sku_catalog.sql`
   - Telco extensions: `20250824170000_sku_catalog_telco_extensions.sql`
   - Consolidated file: `scripts/APPLY_ALL_SKU_MIGRATIONS_NOW.sql`

3. **Import Script**
   - Created: `scripts/import-sku-catalog-347.js`
   - Generates 347 products including:
     - TBWA client products (Alaska, Oishi, Del Monte, JTI, Marca Leon)
     - Competitor products
     - Telco products (Globe, Smart, TNT, TM)
   - Includes halal certification tracking
   - Barcode registry system

4. **MCP Configuration**
   - Updated `.mcp.json` with correct access token
   - Created `.env.mcp` with valid credentials
   - Created `start-claude-mcp.sh` helper script

### ‚è≥ Pending Actions

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply SKU Catalog Migrations
```bash
# Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/cxzllzyxwpyptfretryc/sql/new
2. Copy entire contents of: scripts/APPLY_ALL_SKU_MIGRATIONS_NOW.sql
3. Paste and execute in SQL Editor
4. Verify output shows "SKU Catalog Schema Ready!"

# Option B: Using Supabase CLI (if configured)
supabase db execute -f scripts/APPLY_ALL_SKU_MIGRATIONS_NOW.sql --linked
```

### Step 2: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Run verification script
cd /Users/tbwa/Documents/GitHub/ai-aas-hardened-lakehouse
npm install @supabase/supabase-js dotenv
node scripts/verify-sku-catalog.js
```

### Step 3: Import 347 Products
```bash
# Only after migrations are applied successfully
node scripts/import-sku-catalog-347.js
```

### Step 4: Validate Data
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor to verify import
SELECT 
  'Brands' as entity,
  COUNT(*) as count 
FROM masterdata.brands
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Products' as entity,
  COUNT(*) as count 
FROM masterdata.products
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Telco Products' as entity,
  COUNT(*) as count 
FROM masterdata.telco_products
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Halal Products' as entity,
  COUNT(*) as count 
FROM masterdata.products 
WHERE halal_certified = true;
```

## üìã Expected Results

After successful deployment:
- **Schemas**: `masterdata`, `staging`
- **Tables**: 7 tables in masterdata schema
- **Views**: 4 views for different product perspectives
- **Data**: 347 products across multiple categories
  - ~50 TBWA client products
  - ~200 competitor products
  - ~97 telco products
  - ~30% halal certified products

## üîß MCP Usage (Claude Code CLI)

Once configured, you can use MCP tools directly:
```bash
# Start Claude with MCP support
source start-claude-mcp.sh

# Then in Claude, you can use:
# - Execute SQL directly
# - Query product data
# - Manage migrations
# - Deploy edge functions
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### MCP Authentication Issues
- Ensure `.env.local` has correct `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- Token should start with `sbp_`
- Check token permissions in Supabase dashboard

### Migration Failures
- Check for existing schemas/tables
- Ensure you have proper permissions
- Review error messages in SQL Editor

### Import Script Issues
- Verify migrations applied first
- Check Node.js version (>= 14)
- Ensure `.env.local` has valid credentials

## üìù Quick SQL Checks

```sql
-- Check if migrations applied
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.schemata 
  WHERE schema_name = 'masterdata'
) as schema_exists;

-- Count products by category
SELECT 
  category,
  COUNT(*) as product_count
FROM masterdata.v_product_catalog
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY product_count DESC;

-- View telco products
SELECT * FROM masterdata.v_telco_products LIMIT 10;

-- Check halal products
SELECT * FROM masterdata.v_halal_products LIMIT 10;
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The SKU catalog is successfully deployed when:
1. All schemas and tables exist
2. 347 products are imported
3. Views return data correctly
4. No errors in verification script
5. Can query products by brand, category, telco network, and halal status
