| **No product structure** | ‚úÖ FIXED | - Full item schema: category, product, brand, SKU<br>- `detection_method` tracks source<br>- Schema validation enforced |
| **No financials** | ‚úÖ FIXED | - `unit_price`, `total_price`, `transaction_amount`<br>- `price_source` enum (edge/catalog/pos)<br>- Quality gates for price sanity |
| **No demographics** | ‚úÖ FIXED | - `gender` and `age_bracket` enums<br>- Toggle per store: `demographics_inference`<br>- Supports "unknown" gracefully |
| **No conversation capture** | ‚úÖ FIXED | - STT drives request type/mode classification<br>- `decision_trace.stt.turns` for transcript<br>- Staging table for structured conversations |
| **Quality metrics missing** | ‚úÖ FIXED | - Item-level confidence scores<br>- Materialized views for quality monitoring<br>- Daily trends and anomaly detection |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Gaps

1. **Historical Data** - The 99.67% missing brands in EXISTING data
2. **Data Volume** - Still need to deploy to more stores
3. **Scheduled Monitoring** - Quality reports not yet automated

## üîß Complete Fix Package

### 1. Brand Backfill (Fix Historical Data)
```bash
# Run the backfill script to enrich existing records
psql $POSTGRES_URL -f scripts/backfill-brands.sql

# This will:
# - Create PH brand catalog (70+ common brands)
# - Update existing items where brand_name is null
# - Report new brand coverage percentage
```

### 2. Transcript Staging (Structured Conversations)
```bash
# Create staging tables for conversation analytics
psql $POSTGRES_URL -f scripts/staging-transcripts.sql

# Deploy updated edge function with transcript capture
cp supabase/functions/scout-edge-ingest/index-with-transcripts.ts \
   supabase/functions/scout-edge-ingest/index.ts
   
supabase functions deploy scout-edge-ingest --project-ref your-ref
```

### 3. Quality Monitoring (Automated Reports)
```bash
# Create quality monitoring views
psql $POSTGRES_URL -f scripts/create-quality-monitors.sql

# Query quality summary
psql $POSTGRES_URL -c "SELECT * FROM suqi.data_quality_summary"

# Enable scheduled refresh (if pg_cron available)
psql $POSTGRES_URL -c "SELECT suqi.refresh_quality_views()"
```

## üìä Expected Outcomes

### Before Fix Package
- Brand coverage: 0.33%
- Price capture: Unknown

- Price capture: **85%+** (edge pricing + catalog)
- Demographics: **60%+** (where enabled)
- Quality visibility: **Real-time dashboards**
